# Html Serializer

## Description

This project aims to develop a tool for handling and processing HTML content. The tool can be used for various purposes, such as implementing a Crawler.

A Crawler (or Scraper) is a mechanism that reads websites' HTML and analyzes it to extract the desired information. Essentially, it is what search engines like Google do. The search engine scans the internet and analyzes the HTML of all websites to index the information so it can retrieve it based on users' search queries.

## Features

- Html Serializer: Serialization process to convert HTML data into objects of a programming language.
- Html Query: Service for querying a tree of HtmlElement objects and searching for elements using CSS Selectors.


## Examples

Some common use cases for using a Crawler include:
- Analyzing websites to discover the technologies they are built with and code libraries they use.
- Extracting data from e-commerce or classifieds websites for display on another site.

## Installation

Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the documentation to set up and run the tool.
